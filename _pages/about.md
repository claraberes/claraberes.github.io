Welcome to my website! I am a 5th-year PhD student in the [Sustainable Development program](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/sipa-education/phd-sustainable-development) at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. 

I am an environmental economist with research interests in spatial mobility, avoidance behavior, and green innovation. 

Before starting the PhD, I graduated from Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure Paris-Saclay and obtained bachelor degrees in economics, sociology and philosophy from Sorbonne University. I also worked as consultant in the Environment Directorate at the OECD. 

Don't hesitate to be in touch!
