Welcome to my website! I am a 4th-year PhD student in the [Sustainable Development program](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/sipa-education/phd-sustainable-development) at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs and Climate School. I am an environmental economist with research interests in spatial mobility, avoidance behavior, and green innovation. 

Before starting the PhD, I studied at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure Paris-Saclay and worked at the OECD. Don't hesitate to be in touch!
