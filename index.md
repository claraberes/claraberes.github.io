Welcome to my website! I am a 4th year student in the Sustainable Development PhD Program at Columbia SIPA. I am an environmental economist primarily interested in spatial mobility, avoidance behavior, and green innovation.
Before my PhD I studied at Ecole Normale Sup√©riuere Paris-Saclay and worked at the OECD.
