Welcome to my website! 
I am a 4th year student in the Sustainabel Development PhD program at Columbia SIPA. 
I am an environmental economist interested in spatial mobility, avoidance behavior, and green innovation. 
Before my PhD, I studied at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure Paris-Scalay and worked at the OECD. Feel free to be in touch!
